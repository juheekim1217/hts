## 🧠 Core Technology

The heart of the Superhuman Protocol is a Python Expert System that mimics the decision-making of elite strength coaches:

* Rule-based inference engine (Python + NumPy + Pandas)
* Adaptive session generation based on RPE, readiness, and feedback
* Modular training blocks (Mobility, Strongman, Barbell, Accessories)
* Daily undulating concurrent periodization
* Long-term structural balance and performance tracking

### 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
* **Expert Engine**: Python rule-based logic
* **Frontend**: React Native (mobile)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **DevOps**: Docker + GitHub Actions

## 🧱 Training Framework

| Block | Focus                            | Purpose                                   |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| A     | Mobility & Activation            | Joint health & readiness                  |
| B     | Strongman Carries/Loads          | Real-world strength                       |
| C     | Barbell Max Strength & Endurance | Peak strength and power output            |
| D     | Accessories & Calisthenics       | Weak-point targeting & structural balance |

* **Undulating Load:** Daily intensity variation (Heavy / Moderate / Light)
* **Periodization:** 4-week mesocycles with load waves and deloads
* **Variant Engine:** 8-week freshness guarantee, no repeated combinations

## 📆 Weekly Microcycle Example

| Day | Block B (Strongman) | Block C (Barbell) | Notes                       |
| --- | ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Mon | Heavy Carry         | Moderate SE Lower | OK pairing                  |
| Tue | Moderate            | Heavy ME Upper    | OK pairing                  |
| Wed | Light Medley        | Light Technique   | Recovery day                |
| Thu | Moderate            | Heavy ME Lower    | OK pairing                  |
| Fri | Heavy Load          | Moderate SE Upper | OK pairing                  |
| Sat | Light/Conditioning  | Optional Barbell  | GPP day                     |
| Sun | —                   | —                 | Passive recovery / mobility |

> **Rule:** No Heavy–Heavy pairing on same day (mutex logic)
